  DER Scene exporter manual
=============================

A short manual to the Blender addon scene exporter.
This manual is a subject to change as the exporter changes.


Installing the addon
--------------------
To create a scene one needs to first install the scene exporter from the
"tools" subdir to Blender. This can be achieved by doing the following:

  - Zip the directory "io_scene_der" under the "tools/SceneExport/" to
    "io_scene_der.zip".
  - In Blender open the user preferences (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+U) and select the
    Addons-tab.
  - Click the "Install from file..." and find and select the
    "io_scene_der.zip"
  - If the addon is not active yet (the checkbox not checked) activate it.
    To find the addon in the view just type "der" to the search input in
    the upper left of the window.
  - Now you should be able to export the scenes into .derscene format.


Using the exporter
--------------------
Here are some things to remember when using the exporter to create a scene.

  - The objects exported are only the transform, mesh name and material
    name of the object. The actual mesh needs to be exported separately as
    wavefront obj file.
  - The mesh name saved to the scene file is the name of mesh data of the
    object. Make sure it is the same as the .obj file that you have exported
    into the "assets/models/" subdir without the .obj extension.
    Example: The mesh "assets/models/rusty_shed.obj" would be used by setting
      an objects mesh data name to "rusty_shed".
  - Easiest way to create the scene is to import an .obj file to be used
    in the scene. Then make sure that the mesh data has the correct name.
    If you need to have multiple objects with the same mesh, Alt+D duplicates
    the object so that the new object uses the same mesh data that the original.
